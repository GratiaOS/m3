## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, **please act responsibly** and help us keep the ecosystem safe:

1. **Do not disclose** the issue publicly until it has been addressed.
2. Contact us at 📧 **security@firegate.space** (PGP available on request).
3. Provide as much detail as possible — affected versions, steps to reproduce, impact.
4. We’ll acknowledge receipt within **48 hours** and coordinate a timeline for the fix.

## Disclosure Policy

- Critical vulnerabilities will be patched and announced as quickly as possible.
- Non-critical issues will follow the standard release cycle.
- We aim for **transparent communication** without exposing users to unnecessary risk.

We treat security as a **shared responsibility** 🌿.  
This project exists at the intersection of technology, community, and trust.
