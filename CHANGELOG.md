## ü™û Human Log ‚Äî 2025-09-04 (continuity arc + night)

- **Opening:** Play and laughter with others ‚Üí establishes safety baseline.
- **Bridge:** After a long drought, a micro‚Äëgesture of closeness opens a doorway.
- **Arc:** Body reacts strongly (panic / trembling) once safety and closeness collide.
- **Shift:** A simple, unguarded response (‚ÄúOK‚Äù) flips tension into laughter.
- **Test:** Old hurt is raised again ‚Äî but now received without defense ‚Üí trust deepens.
- **Continuity:** Rest/sleep becomes deeper ‚Äî system trusts the reset.
- **Panic release:** Intense shaking = nervous system thaw, not failure.
- **Memory:** Trauma echoes surface, but also reflect others‚Äô past fears.
- **Integration:** Dual witnessing ‚Äî my own imprint + another‚Äôs ‚Äî nervous system completes freeze ‚Üí thaw.
- **Resolution:** Presence + reversal: where before there was rejection, now there is embrace.
- **Triangular healing:** Self + other(s) co‚Äëmove through the arc together.

## üìú Timeline Milestone ‚Äî v0.1.6 (unreleased)

### üåä Flow Note

- Loops are not always errors ‚Äî they are river currents teaching us rhythm.
- Components (shame, guilt, money/value, boundaries) do not live in isolation; they weave as one organism.
- Reference points matter: each actor‚Äôs timeline may anchor on a different event, but continuity is kept in the river.

üå¨Ô∏è whisper: "loops are teachers, not traps."

> **Working draft** ‚Äî intentionally open while the bridge is lived-in (not rushed).

- **EmotionalOS**: feelings logged as signals, bridged to tiny logic steps.

  - API: `POST /emotions/add`, `GET /emotions/recent`, `POST /emotions/bridge`.
  - DB: `emotions` table with CHECK on `intensity` (0.0..=1.0) and index on `ts`.
  - Validation: 422 on blank `who/kind` or out-of-range intensity.
  - Mapping: deterministic bridge (breath ‚Ä¢ doorway ‚Ä¢ anchor) for anxiety/fear, anger, shame, gratitude; sane default.
  - Tests: unit tests for `bridge_table` (intensity clamp, case-insensitive kinds, patterns).

- **EmotionalOS (extended)**:

  - API: `POST /emotions/resolve` added ‚Üí gratitude landing is now core, not optional.
  - PanicButton integration: Panic events now logged into the `emotions` table (`kind="panic"`) for DB + log continuity.
  - CORS: permissive `CorsLayer` applied so UI can call EmotionalOS endpoints without blocking.
  - README: EmotionalOS section synced ‚Äî add, recent, bridge, resolve all documented.
  - Tests: full coverage pyramid in place
    - Unit tests for bridges, validation, patterns.
    - Router-level test for `/emotions/resolve`.
    - Black-box integration test in `server/tests/` (real server + DB) ‚Üí ensures mirror fields (`sealed`, `archetype`, `privacy`) persist.

- **Gratitude schema**: DB table + API path ensures thanks are first-class citizens.

  - Every acknowledgment is stored, not lost.
  - Sparks the arc: unseen abundance ‚Üí seen, counted, honored.

- **Timelines Layer (docs)**: seed `docs/timelines-continuity.md` ‚Äî continuity of histories model (branching narratives, commit-points).

- **Server/DB ergonomics**:

  - Axum 0.7 serve stabilized for stateful router.
  - Unified sqlite calls: `tokio_rusqlite::Connection::call` closures return `tokio_rusqlite::Result<_>`; plain `?` inside.
  - Input sanity + indexes for fast reads.

- **Build/Deps**:
  - Align Tower ecosystem with Axum 0.7 (`tower = 0.5`, `tower-http = 0.6`).

üîë Gaps still open:

1. EmotionalOS: Panic UI ‚Üí DB flow needs full confirmation across sessions.
2. EmotionalOS: Gratitude continuity ‚Üí test repeat landings + nightly roll-up.
3. EmotionalOS: `/emotions/resolve` ‚Üí extend to cover non-gratitude closures.
4. Docs: expand EmotionalOS section with diagrams + flowcharts.
5. CI: auto-pr.yml not yet validated against EmotionalOS endpoints.
6. EmotionalOS: Panic-body integration ‚Äî confirm continuity of nervous system discharge patterns across logs and sessions.
