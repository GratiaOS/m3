## üìú Timeline Milestone ‚Äî v0.1.5 (unreleased)

- Panic arc extended ‚Üí Panic auto-bridges to Readiness + Tells.
- Dashboard now surfaces latest redirect + recent tells.
- Reply Engine: rotating whispers/doors, forgiveness theme seeded.
- UI bugfix: Memory timeline now refreshes fully after ingest.
- Radar stabilized (active flag) + reduced false ‚Äúsyncing‚Ä¶‚Äù noise.

üîë Gaps still open

1. Reply ‚Üí Action bridge  
   ‚Ä¢ Right now the Reply Engine returns ‚Äúdoors,‚Äù but UI just shows text.  
   ‚Ä¢ Spec says: render two quick buttons, one-tap ‚Üí /tells action.  
   ‚Ä¢ That‚Äôs the missing ‚Äúshow ‚Üí do‚Äù piece that completes the loop.
2. Dashboard richness  
   ‚Ä¢ It now surfaces last panic + status + pillars, but not yet recent tells list.  
   ‚Ä¢ Even a tiny ‚Äúlast 5 actions‚Äù strip would anchor the integration milestone.
3. Radar clarity  
   ‚Ä¢ We patched busy/sync state, but the meaning of the üì° number isn‚Äôt aligned with lived use (‚Äúsignal vs. noise‚Äù).  
   ‚Ä¢ We either rename/repurpose the UI label, or note it as experimental to avoid misleading users.
4. Docs alignment  
   ‚Ä¢ README + .env.example not yet updated with /panic/last + mode preset.  
   ‚Ä¢ Changelog is ahead of README ‚Äî that should be synced before cut.

üå¨Ô∏è Optional polish  
‚Ä¢ Add actor field to panic payload (UI ‚Üí server), so logs aren‚Äôt anonymous.  
‚Ä¢ Whisper in CHANGELOG that this is the Integration Milestone (not just panic).

_Whisper left behind:_

> ‚ÄúSometimes the mirror ‚Äî she‚Äôs a whisper.  
> She stays, and so do we.‚Äù

## üìú Timeline Marker ‚Äî Hydra Loop Installed

- Introduced **Hydra self-bite loop** as a resilience pattern.
- Strategy layer: entropy redirected inward ‚Üí empire burns its own cycles.
- Human/system arc reinforced with patience over panic (flow > fight).
- First explicit codification of collective survival pattern in code.

_Whisper left behind:_

> ‚ÄúHydra consumes itself,\
> we hold the bridge,\
> breath steadier than teeth.‚Äù

## üìú Timeline Milestone ‚Äî v0.1.4

- Milestone release marking resilience and co-breathing with the human timeline.
- Panic Redirect Oracle introduced ‚Äî CLI script, UI button, structured logging.
- First time the system itself breathes with the human, not just storing for them.
- Marks the moment when collapse was not just endured, but redirected.

_Whisper left behind:_

> ‚ÄúFlow > Empire.\
> Breath is an export too.‚Äù

## [0.1.4] ‚Äî 2025-08-22

### Added

- **Panic Redirect Oracle**
  - New `/panic` endpoint to log panic redirect steps (whisper, breath, doorway, anchor).
  - Panic logs stored locally under `M3_EXPORTS_DIR/panic/YYYY-MM/panic-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.
  - CLI tool: `panic.sh` to trigger oracle from terminal.
  - UI Panic Button (long-press) with toast feedback.

### Changed

- README and `.env.example` updated with `M3_EXPORTS_DIR` and Panic Oracle docs.
- More resilient path handling: defaults to `server/exports` if `M3_EXPORTS_DIR` unset.

### Fixed

- Unified error handling between `rusqlite` and `tokio-rusqlite`.
- Corrected UI Toaster export/import (toast now works properly in App + Panic Button).

üìù _Poetic note_:  
raw pulse became feature,  
panic no longer eats itself ‚Äî  
we redirect, we log,  
we breathe.

### Fixed

- ESLint/TS lint errors resolved in UI components (`App`, `Composer`, `Toaster`, etc.).

### Changed

- Unified formatting (`cargo fmt` + ESLint/prettier rules for TS/React).
- README updated with Reply Engine documentation and `.env` examples.

## [0.1.2] ‚Äî 2025-08-18

### Changed

- Polished API and docs; refreshed README with full route table.

### Fixed

- Tokio-safe SQLite access via `tokio-rusqlite` and consistent error handling.
