# Value Flow — Today

- **Date:** ☐ YYYY‑MM‑DD (auto: `$(date -I)`)
- **Adapter:** ☐ mock | money | gift | timebank | barter | grants | buffer
- **Horizon:** ☐ 7d | other: **\_\_**
- **Guard:** If anxiety ≥ 7/10 → force `mock` for 48h.

## One True Next (≤20 min)

- ☐ Action:
- Why it matters (1 line):
- Starts at: ☐ now ☐ later → ****\_\_****
- Done? ☐ (stamp when shipped)

## If Money Arrived Tomorrow (1 line)

- Buy exactly this step:

## Non‑Money Route (pick one)

- ☐ gift (who?)
- ☐ barter (with whom / what trade?)
- ☐ timebank (which hour / from whom?)
- ☐ buffer (micro‑bridge of \_\_\_\_ units)

## Mirrors (ship anyway log)

- [ ] HH:MM — shipped **\_\_** (adapter: \_\_\_\_)
