# Funding — a gentle story 🌱

_“Offer only what you love. The field doesn't need more hustle — it needs wholeness.”_

Funding here is not urgency—it’s nurture. A steady breeze that lets us design, repair, and tend the work with care.

## What we’re tending 🌿

- 🌿 **Garden Core** — tokens, primitives, and patterns for living UIs.
- 🧠 **M3** — a local‑first memory &amp; meaning engine (Rust server + React UI).
- 🔥 **Firegate** — a sacred interface for memory, creation, and conversation.

## How support flows 💧

There are many ways to water the garden—each valid, each welcome:

- 💚 **Money** (sponsorships, one‑time gifts, purchases)
- ⏳ **Time** (volunteering on docs, issues, or community care)
- 🛠️ **Skills** (design, coding, writing, facilitation)
- 🎁 **Gifts** (tools, resources, hardware)
- 🤝 **Barter** (mutual exchange)
- 📝 **Grants** (structured support for bigger arcs)
- 🫧 **Buffers** (small reserves to soften the unknown)

No pressure. Join when love and resources align. Cancel or change anytime.

## Where the water goes 🪴

Sponsorship funds focused time for design, docs, and maintenance; keeps our **infra** healthy; and preserves a **calm** pace—no growth‑at‑all‑costs pressure.

We allocate thoughtfully to:

- 🔧 Hosting, CI, storage, and tools
- 💻 Open‑source development &amp; ongoing technical work
- 🫂 Community care (events, communication, wellbeing)
- 🧘 Modest buffers for resilience and continuity

Transparency: we publish a simple **monthly mirror**—what came in, what it nourished. 🪞 No paywalls, just shared momentum. 🪴

## Rhythm &amp; goal 🌬️

We work by the **One True Next**: the smallest 20–90s step that moves the story.  
This keeps the room quiet and the focus clear.

**Goal — “First Breath”** 🎯  
**$333/month** covers CI, storage, and domains **+** one calm maker day/month to land docs &amp; tidy.  
Thank you for watering the garden. 🌿

If you like guidance on pacing:

| Contribution            | Focus                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Small** ($5–$50/mo)   | Keep community &amp; infrastructure steady. |
| **Moderate** ($50–$200) | Enable dedicated development &amp; care.    |
| **Larger** ($200+)      | Sustain broader arcs and healthy buffers.   |

## Choose a tier (monthly or one‑time) 🌳

- 🌱 **Seed — $7/mo**  
  You water the roots. Your support keeps CI, hosting, and the little things calm.  
  _Perks:_ gratitude, and your name on the Sponsors list (or 🌱 Anonymous Seed).

- 🌿 **Sapling — $21/mo**  
  You help a week breathe easier. This funds design time, docs, and tiny passes.  
  _Perks:_ everything in Seed + a short quarterly field note (what bloomed, what’s next).

- 🌳 **Grove — $77/mo**  
  You create momentum. Grove covers focused maker hours for Garden &amp; M3.  
  _Perks:_ Seed + Sapling + occasional early peeks at experiments (demos, docs) when available.

- 🌲 **Forest — $210/mo**  
  You give shade to many. Forest funds a chunk of dedicated build time and care.  
  _Perks:_ all above + one optional “garden hour” per quarter (Q&amp;A / pairing / design jam).

## 60‑second activation (free, now) ⏱️

Try this once—see if the room changes:

1. **Breathe:** 🌬️ In 3 · Out 6 × 6 (jaw soft, shoulders drop).
2. **Name the band:** 🎼 slow · flow · heavy.
3. **One true next:** ✨ the smallest step you can actually do.
4. **Thank one thing:** 🙏 out loud, even quietly.

_If nothing else, keep this. It’s yours._

## Mirrors 🪞

Each step shipped, each contribution made, is a reflection of our shared journey.  
We celebrate these moments—as milestones of care and commitment.
