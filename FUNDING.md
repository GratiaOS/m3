# Funding Strategy

---

## 1. Intent

Funding exists to nurture and sustain the flow of our work, not to incite fear or urgency. It is a gentle support system that enables creativity, care, and connection to flourish.  
_“Offer only what you love. The field doesn't need more hustle — it needs wholeness.”_

Our intention is to create a space where contributions are acts of love and alignment, not pressure or panic.

## 2. Ways to Contribute

There are many meaningful ways to support this work, each valuable and welcome:

- **Money:** Direct financial support through donations, sponsorships, or purchases.
- **Time:** Volunteering hours to help with tasks, events, or community engagement.
- **Skills:** Offering expertise in areas like design, coding, writing, or facilitation.
- **Gifts:** Sharing resources, tools, or materials that enrich the project.
- **Barter:** Exchanging services or goods in a mutually beneficial way.
- **Grants:** Applying for or providing structured funding to sustain larger initiatives.
- **Buffers:** Creating small reserves to cushion unpredictability and maintain stability.

Each contribution weaves into the fabric of our shared journey.

## 3. How We Use Funds

Transparency guides our stewardship of resources. Funds are allocated thoughtfully to:

- Maintain and improve infrastructure (hosting, tools, platforms).
- Support open-source development and ongoing technical work.
- Foster community care, including events, communication, and wellbeing.
- Build small financial buffers to ensure resilience and continuity.

Every dollar is a seed planted to nourish the whole.

## 4. Lightweight Flow

Our approach centers on clarity and calm, focusing on the “One True Next” step each day. This flow helps us:

- Identify the most meaningful next action without overwhelm.
- Remove anxiety triggers by embracing simplicity and presence.
- Honor the rhythm of contribution as it naturally arises.

This lightweight flow invites steady progress grounded in intention.

## 5. When Funded

Begin or deepen your engagement when love and resources align. Here’s a gentle guide to pacing:

| Contribution Level         | Suggested Focus                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Small (e.g., $5–$50/month) | Support ongoing community and infrastructure needs.    |
| Moderate (e.g., $50–$200)  | Enable dedicated development and care initiatives.     |
| Larger (e.g., $200+)       | Sustain broader projects and build meaningful buffers. |

There is no rush or pressure — just an open invitation to participate as you are able.

## 6. Mirrors

Each step shipped, each contribution made, is a reflection of our collective journey. We celebrate these moments, regardless of scale or source, as milestones of care and commitment.  
Together, we honor the flow and the love that sustains it.
