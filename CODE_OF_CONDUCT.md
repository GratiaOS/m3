## 🪴 Stewardship

Garden maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards.  
They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions (code, issues, comments, etc.) that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct — or to temporarily/permanently ban contributors for behavior they believe violates this code.

## 🌀 Scope

This Code applies in all Garden spaces, including GitHub repositories, community chats, live events, and any public or private spaces where this project is represented.  
It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project.

## 📨 Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers through the channels listed in the repository README.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
