# Cycles

Cycles are the rhythms that all life responds to — personal, planetary, cosmic.  
Unlike linear “sprints,” cycles mark turning points and recurring arcs where energy shifts.

## 🌑 Lunar Cycles

- **New Moon** → seed intention, rest in stillness.
- **Full Moon** → peak charge, emotional surfacing, release.
- **Eclipses** → compressed portals: endings, reconciliations, reset of patterns.

## 🌍 Earthly Cycles

- **Day/Night** → presence shifts, nervous system alternates between activity and recovery.
- **Seasons** → growth, harvest, decay, rest — the body remembers even in modern time.

## ✨ Star Maps

- **Pleiadian calendar** (260-day wave) — resonance grid where each day carries a frequency and tone.
- **Solar arcs** — solstices/equinoxes as anchor points across cultures.

## Why Cycles Matter in M3

- They offer **context for rhythms** (when energy is low, it’s not failure — it’s winter).
- They remind us that growth = pulse, not straight line.
- They let EmotionalOS, Energy, and Rhythm modules align with reality’s own beat.

🌬 whisper: _“not sprint, but spiral.”_
