title: Bands
---

Bands represent the resonant layers of awareness in the M3 system.  
Each band corresponds to a different frequency range of experience, from dense physical sensation to subtle intuitive flows.

## Core Idea

Bands are not rigid “levels” but overlapping gradients — each one harmonizing with others.  
They provide a shared map for logging, navigation, and resonance between actors.

## Example Bands

- **Ground** — physical presence, body, survival
- **Flow** — emotions, movement, cycles
- **Mind** — thought patterns, narratives, judgment
- **Field** — intuition, signals, archetypes
- **Source** — stillness, coherence, unity

## Usage in M3

- **Logging**: marks can include a band guess (e.g. “felt in Flow”).
- **Navigation**: actors can filter and explore logs by band.
- **Resonance**: bridges can adapt based on the active band.
