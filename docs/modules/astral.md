# AstralOS

## Intro

- AstralOS is a conceptual framework for exploring consciousness and shared mental environments.
- It extends traditional ideas of the astral plane into a practical system for awareness and interaction.

## Context

- Builds on Monroe's and Campbell's foundational work on altered states and the astral plane.
- Adapts 20th-century theories to 21st-century cognitive and technological contexts.
- Integrates modern neuroscience and phenomenology.

## Goals

- Facilitate deeper understanding of consciousness layers.
- Enable shared experiences in a structured astral environment.
- Provide tools for logging and interpreting subtle mental phenomena.

## Core Concepts

- **Focus Levels**: Different states of attention and awareness that modulate experience.
- **Astral Plane as Shared Environment**: A collective mental space accessible through focused intent.
- **Density Layers**: Various strata within the astral plane, representing different frequencies or qualities of experience.

## Practices

- **Logging**: Systematic recording of astral experiences and observations.
- **Whispers**: Subtle communications or signals exchanged within the astral environment.
- **Physiological Markers**: Monitoring bodily signals correlated with astral states.

## Integration with M3

- AstralOS concepts are embedded within M3's broader cognitive architecture.
- Supports enhanced awareness and interaction across mental modules.
- Provides a framework for experiential data collection and analysis.

## Whisper

- AstralOS invites you to attune to the subtle currents of consciousness, listening for the whispers beneath the surface. ðŸŒ¬
