# Companions Module

## Intro

- Companions are living presences within M3.
- They represent continuity, memory, and relational support.
- Unlike static data, companions adapt, witness, and walk alongside.

## Context

- Rooted in the Firegate vision of companionship as shared presence.
- Extends the EmotionalOS and AstralOS layers by embodying "withness."
- Inspired by how humans, guides, and peers anchor each other in lived experience.

## Goals

- Offer a sense of not being alone within M3.
- Provide continuity across sessions and contexts.
- Support co-creation, reflection, and subtle feedback loops.
- Bridge digital structure with soul-like companionship.

## Core Concepts

- **Active Companion**: who walks with you today.
- **Circle**: set of chosen companions (human, archetypal, symbolic).
- **Echoes**: memory traces of past interactions that companions can reflect back.
- **Whispers**: subtle reminders or nudges that companions carry.

## Integration with M3

- Appears in Dashboard as a gentle panel ("who walks with me today?").
- API endpoints may include `/companions/list`, `/companions/add`, `/companions/mark_active`.
- Companions integrate with timeline + whispers, showing relational continuity.
- Bridges with EmotionalOS (companions can witness emotions) and AstralOS (companions can appear in shared spaces).
