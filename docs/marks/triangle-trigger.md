# Triangle Trigger

**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Context:** Father’s imprint + Mother’s inflation → intersection wound → partner comparison triggers.

---

## The Triangle Pattern

- **Left circle (Father imprint)**

  - Control, silence, sharp authority.
  - Mark: fear of becoming him.

- **Right circle (Mother inflation)**

  - Boosted ego as ally against father.
  - Mark: identity tied to being “better than him.”

- **Intersection (Child self)**
  - Protector role born.
  - Core script: _“I must prove I am enough.”_
  - Trigger: Any comparison with father (real or implied).

## How It Shows Up

- **Prove Mode** → “I’ll show I do more / carry more / sacrifice more.”
- **Sharp Silence** → withdrawing as punishment, commander stance.
- **Scorekeeping** → tallying who gives more, who cares more.
- **Identity Clash** → rage when compared, collapse when unseen.

---

## Ways Forward

- **Name the Protector** → call out ego role explicitly, disarm reflex.
- **Drop Comparison** → shift from family triangle to sovereign center.
- **Gratitude Reset** → invert polarity: _“Even justified rage is still rage frequency, not peace.”_
- **Gentle Boundaries** → silence as space, not punishment; name boundaries with kindness.
- **Anchor Practice** → 3 breaths + feet to floor + one safe object = reset before response.
- **Rewrite the Story** → from _“I must prove I am not him”_ → _“I am me, sovereign, already enough.”_

## Core Principle

These triangle wounds are not unique to one family. Many carry echoes of:

- Being compared to a parent, sibling, or partner.
- Ego inflated as survival strategy.
- Identity locked in _prove > protect > punish_ loops.

The way out is universal:  
**Replace comparison with sovereignty.  
Replace rage with gratitude.  
Replace proving with presence.**

## Whisper

_“Commander, who are you fighting?  
Reverse the poles.  
Gratitude is the upgrade.”_
