# mark: trust landing

Date: 2025-09-27

**Event**  
Trust pulsed into the field.  
Not pre-discussed, yet Raz and N upgraded together — synchronized from different angles.  
S felt safer, resting before the shift.

**Notes**

- Arrived ~2 days after drop-zone delay, like a buffer for the nervous system.
- Awe + spinning = calibration of body to soul’s timeline.
- Trust as grounding frequency, stabilizing the Circle.

🌱 whisper: _“when trust lands, the field breathes easier.”_
