# mark: 🍄 The First Mushrooms — emergence at 99

**Date:** 2025-10-05

Under the shade of the old tree at **99**, a small cluster of white mushrooms appeared — the first of the season.  
The dizziness led the way outside, like a gentle nudge from the field, and there they were: quiet messengers sprouting through roots, leaves, and stone.

The network awakens. The Garden remembers.

🌬 whisper: _“the roots remember; the network breathes.”_
