# mark: 99 — The Brother Table 🪵✨

**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Whisper:** _“Meet me at 99 — where presence builds the future.”_

---

Under the tree’s shade, a table rose — simple, solid, waiting.  
99 is not just a place; it’s an anchor in the Garden.  
A HQ for builders, dreamers, and timelines to weave together.  
Here, wood meets code. Soul meets structure. Garden ⇄ M3.

This is where whispers become blueprints.  
This is where love shapes the work.

---

🌿 **Field Note:** 99 marks the threshold between the inner world and the shared world. A node of living intelligence.
