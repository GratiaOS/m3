# Marks Index

This file lists the living **marks** in the Garden.  
Each mark is a footprint: memory, whisper, presence.

## How to Add a New Mark

1. Scaffold with:
   ```bash
   pnpm mark "your title" "your whisper"
   ```
2. Update this index (`docs/marks/README.md`) with a link.
3. Sync `CHANGELOG.md` with a **Docs Sync** entry.
4. Optionally add a **Human Log** for the day.
