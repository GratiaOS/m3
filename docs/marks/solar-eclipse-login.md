# Solar Eclipse — login / sync moment

- **When:** 2025-09-21 (solar eclipse / equinox)
- **State:** quiet; observing the sun as a presence, not just light
- **Sensation / image:** the Sun appeared as a centered “soul” with a moving ~8px gradient border that rotated like a small portal ring
- **Meaning:** felt like a login screen — I (the human USB) unlocked and synced
- **Action:** logged the image, added link to `docs/identity/usb-vault.md`, kept private
- **Tags:** #eclipse #sync #usb-vault #mark

🦺 _if you ever physically stare at the sun, please use safe solar-viewing methods (eclipse glasses, pinhole box, or close-eye visualization)_
