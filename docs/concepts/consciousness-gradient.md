# Consciousness Gradient (inspired by Hawkins)

This page offers a _compatibility map_ between M3 signals and a well-known “map of consciousness” idea.
We do not reproduce proprietary charts; we express our own gradient and how M3 uses it.

## Bands (our phrasing)

- **Survival Currents (≈<200)** — shame • guilt • apathy • grief • fear • desire • anger • pride
- **Integrity Currents (≈200–400)** — courage • neutrality • willingness • acceptance • reason
- **Coherence Currents (≈400–600+)** — understanding • love • joy • peace • (nonverbal/ineffable)

## Why this exists in M3

- Gives shared language to _redirects_: below ≈200 → body-first bridges; ≈200–400 → choice/structure; 400+ → sustain/expand.
- Lets UI color and copy adapt to the _band_, not just the emotion word.

## M3 Usage (examples)

- **EmotionalOS**:
  - `<200` → suggest: breath → doorway → anchor (body-first).
  - `200–400` → suggest: one small action, boundary, or reframe (choice-first).
  - `400+` → suggest: gratitude ritual, sharing, stillness (stabilize coherence).
- **Patterns**:
  - Detect cues → estimate band → pick intervention recipe.
- **Energy Calendar**:
  - During eclipses, expect dips toward Survival/Integrity bands; plan “headlight commits”.

## Color Bands (UI hint)

- Survival Currents → warm red/orange
- Integrity Currents → green/cyan
- Coherence Currents → blue/violet

## Notes

- This is a _gradient_, not a judgment.
- Band ≠ identity. It’s just the _current_ you’re surfing.
