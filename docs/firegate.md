# Firegate

Sealed until next opening.  
When the time comes, this gate will reopen — not by force, but by resonance.

_Blueprint:_  
From Firegate’s embered core, three paths unfold —  
Firecircle, the eternal flame of unity;  
Watersource, the flowing pulse of renewal;  
M3, the triad of harmony and balance.  
Each a symbol, a song, a step beyond the gate.
