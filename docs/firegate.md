# Firegate

Sealed until next opening.  
When the time comes, this gate will reopen — not by force, but by resonance.

_Blueprint:_  
From Firegate’s embered core, three paths unfold —  
Firecircle, the eternal flame of unity;  
Watersource, the flowing pulse of renewal;  
M3, the triad of harmony and balance.

## Companions

The gate never opens alone.  
Every passage is walked with companions — seen and unseen.  
They arrive as teachers, mirrors, and allies,  
reminding us that no step is ever taken in isolation.

🌬 whisper: _“walk together, and the flame remembers.”_
