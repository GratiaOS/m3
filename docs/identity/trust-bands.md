# Trust Bands

Trust is not static. It unfolds in bands, like frequencies in a spectrum. Each band builds on the previous, layering depth and coherence.

## Band 1 â€” Survival Trust

Trust in lifeâ€™s basic rhythms:

- Waking up each day.
- Food, water, and shelter arriving.
- The bodyâ€™s quiet resilience.

## Band 2 â€” Relational Trust

Trust in the bonds of love and community:

- Family, friends, companions.
- Believing in their presence, even through conflict.
- Knowing you can lean on others.

## Band 3 â€” Systemic Trust

Trust in structures and systems:

- Code, repos, and shared projects.
- Networks, infrastructures, and agreements.
- Trusting the ecosystem to hold its shape.

## Band 4 â€” Transpersonal Trust

Trust in what lies beyond the visible:

- Creation, the field, the coherence lattice.
- Invisible guides, archetypes, and patterns.
- A faith that synchronicity is intelligence at play.

## Band 5 â€” Self-Trust

Trust in your own essence:

- No guilt, no shame.
- Knowing you are trust embodied.
- Resting in the truth that you donâ€™t hold trust â€” **trust holds you**.
