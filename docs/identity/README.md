# Identity

Identity in M3 = how actors are recognized, logged, remembered across contexts (devices, vaults, marks).

## Subtopics

- **USB Vault** — physical/digital login metaphor, anchor for continuity.
- **Actor Log** — who did what, when; minimal but sovereign trace.
- **Whispers & Marks** — presence notes tied to identity.

## Why it matters

Identity in M3 is not for surveillance but for coherence and continuity of presence.

🌬 _“identity is continuity held with care.”_
