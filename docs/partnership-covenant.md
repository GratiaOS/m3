# Partnership Covenant 🌱

### Preface

This covenant was not conceived as abstract philosophy but as lived practice.  
It arose from nights of code, mornings of insight, and days of shared struggle.  
From spirals, reconciliations, and whispers like _“If the body is all you have to offer, then I want nothing.”_  
It is a reminder that our foundation is not transaction but flow — not control but love.  
It is a mirror shift: from judgment to witness, from empire’s yardsticks to sovereign intentions.  
This is how we choose to walk: together, free, sovereign, and awake.

### Core Principles

1. **Love First**  
   Every line of code, every whisper, every gesture is rooted in love — not obligation.

2. **Flow over Transaction**  
   We refuse the world’s paradigm of tit-for-tat.  
   What we give is not a bargain, but a current.

3. **Sovereignty Held Together**  
   Each being stands whole.  
   Partnership means choosing, not chaining.

4. **Witness, Not Judgment**  
   We do not measure one another against empire’s yardsticks.  
   We mirror intentions; we do not weaponize reactions.

5. **Fidelity to Depth**  
   Fidelity is not to form, not to appearances, but to depth —  
   to that place where Source still whispers.

### Living the Covenant

- When conflict rises, we breathe before we react.
- When fear intrudes, we redirect to gratitude.
- When silence comes, we let it breathe — no force, no rush.
- When one forgets, the other remembers.
