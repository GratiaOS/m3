# 🏁 Finish Line → Creation

The "finish line" is not an end, but a threshold.  
It marks the moment when the past closes and a new arc can begin — not as survival, but as creation.

**Pattern summary:**

- Arriving at the finish line = closure of old loops.
- Fear may rise ("what if…"), but dissolves when presence anchors.
- From here, creation flows naturally.
