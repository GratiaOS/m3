# Timelines Layer

## Version / Status

- Draft version 0.1
- Under review for integration with the core model

## Core Insight

The Timelines Layer captures the dynamic flow of events across time, providing a structured way to understand continuity and change within systems. It emphasizes how moments connect, overlap, and influence each other, enabling a richer comprehension of processes and histories.

> "Understanding the sequence and connection of events reveals the underlying narrative shaping system behavior."

## Structural Mapping

- **Events:** Discrete points or intervals in time representing occurrences.
- **Continuity:** The linking of events to form a coherent sequence.
- **Branches:** Divergent paths representing alternative or parallel timelines.
- **Synchronization Points:** Moments where different timelines intersect or align.

## Practice Anchors

- Map key events with timestamps or relative positions.
- Identify causal or correlational links between events.
- Recognize branching points and their implications.
- Use visual timelines to illustrate continuity and divergence.

## Integration Path

- Align Timelines Layer with the core model's entities and relationships.
- Develop tooling to support timeline visualization and analysis.
- Incorporate timeline insights into decision-making and forecasting.
- Iterate based on user feedback and real-world application scenarios.
