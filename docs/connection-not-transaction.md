# 🌱 Connection, Not Transaction

**Version:** v0.1.6  
**Status:** Seed (Relational Agreement Module)

---

## 🌿 Why

We choose to share life because we love and value each other, not to trade.

## 🛡️ Ground Rule

Connection is never a transaction.

- Not body for safety.
- Not effort for love.
- Not silence for peace.

## 🤲 What We Give

Presence, attention, and care — offered freely, never as currency.

## 💚 What We Need

Clarity and respect.  
When pressure feels like a trade, pause and name it.

## 🔄 How We Reset

- Take one breath.
- Speak one simple truth: _“I feel like I’m trading, not connecting.”_
- Remember: _love is not earned, it is shared._

## 🤝 Promise

We choose connection over transaction, even when tired, scared, or hurting.
