# Privacy Policy (Draft)

This project follows an **open‑source process** approach but is not an **open diary**. While we embrace transparency and sharing, we are committed to respecting the privacy and personal boundaries of individuals involved.

## Commitments

- We protect the personal details of family members and close relations, including names, events, and any identifying data.
- Our public sharing focuses on extracting _patterns, insights, and flows_ rather than exposing raw personal information.
- Raw logs and detailed data may exist privately but any public layer will anonymize or abstract sensitive parts to ensure privacy.

## Scope

- Privacy applies not only to family and close relations but also to collaborators, friends, and anyone mentioned.
- This covenant respects all voices and presences within the project’s narrative, regardless of proximity.

_“Privacy is the circle drawn around the circle.”_

## Data Handling

- Raw logs remain private, securely stored, and may be encrypted or sealed to protect sensitive content.
- Only anonymized or abstracted data is shared publicly, ensuring personal details are obscured or generalized.

_“Guard the raw, share the refined.”_

## Public vs. Private Layers

- “Sealed” data refers to protected records kept confidential to preserve trust and context.
- “Human logs” are curated narratives or summaries shaped by mindful reflection before sharing.
- What is opened to the public is carefully abstracted; what remains sealed safeguards dignity and privacy.

_“Some doors open, others stay closed by choice.”_

## Right to Redaction

- Any person mentioned may request removal or redaction of their information at any time.
- This right is honored promptly, reflecting ongoing respect and care.

_“The story bends to the needs of its people.”_

## Ethics over Legalism

- This covenant is rooted in care, responsibility, and ethical commitment beyond mere legal requirements.
- It is a promise to nurture trust and human dignity within and beyond the project.

_“Law is the letter; ethics is the spirit.”_

## Future Technology

- Soul‑tech tools support our work, aiding insight and pattern recognition while respecting privacy boundaries.
- We commit to avoiding misuse such as re-identification or breaking sealed contexts.
- Technology serves as a tool, never a breach.

_“Machines assist; humans protect.”_
