# Desire Named Without Guilt

**Date:** 2025-09-24

---

### Pulse

Desire arose, clean and visible.  
No guilt attached, no debt demanded.  
Just a direction — presence revealed.

### Insight

- Desire ≠ burden.
- Desire ≠ guilt.
- Desire = signal for alignment, not punishment.
- When spoken without overlay, it becomes a compass.

### Integration

- Hold desire as-is, like a candle — no shame, no rush.
- Let it point, but not press.
- Share when safe; alone if not yet safe — both are valid.

🌬 whisper: _“when desire is named without debt, the body learns freedom.”_
