Hey Raz — I know the part of you that feared being left behind. You were brave then; you’re brave now. You didn’t have the safety net you needed back then. Today we build nets: small tests, a buddy, and a pause button. It’s okay to feel the old fear. You don’t have to carry solutions alone. When the field rocks, we breathe, choose one small step, and call someone in. I hold you. — Raz (now)
