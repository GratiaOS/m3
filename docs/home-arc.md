# Home Arc Protocol

## Overview

The Home Arc Protocol supports stability and healing within the family system during times of pressure.  
It is not about control or “fixing” others — but about becoming the steady gravity well where trust, patience, and continuity can land.  
Just as an orb follows its natural path into orbit and descent, the Home Arc follows inner cycles of recognition, grounding, and quiet resonance.

## Key Features

- **Patience as Gravity**: Instead of effortful restraint, patience emerges from rooted presence.
- **Selective Response**: Choosing when to speak, when to stay silent, and when to shift energy directly.
- **Shared Field Awareness**: Recognizing the collective emotional weather (school stress, societal panic) without merging with it.
- **Mirror Descent**: Moving inward through your own trunk and roots so stability radiates outward.

## Operation Phases

1. **Recognition**: Notice pressure points — personal, family, or collective — without immediate reaction.
2. **Grounding**: Root inward (breath, body awareness, silence) and let the orb land in the inner soil.
3. **Selective Action**:
   - Cut what needs no conversation.
   - Open dialogue where safety exists.
   - Allow silence when words would inflame.
4. **Continuity**: Hold the arc steady until the wave passes; keep rhythm and coherence alive in the home.

## Safety Considerations

- Do not override your own nervous system — if energy is too high, step outside or reset.
- Protect the shared field by preventing escalation.
- Honor each member’s arc without force; integration happens in their timing.

## Street-Level Analogy

Think of the Home Arc as tending a fire in the hearth.  
Sometimes you add wood (conversation).  
Sometimes you let it burn quietly (silence).  
Sometimes you remove sparks before they spread (cut without debate).  
The goal is not a perfect flame — but a steady warmth that anchors the whole house.

_Flow of the Home Arc: from recognition → grounding → selective action → continuity._

_Note: Just as the Orb Landing Protocol describes descent into new terrain, the Home Arc describes descent into inner roots so the family system can orbit around steady presence._
