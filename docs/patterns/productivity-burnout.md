# Pattern: Productivity → Burnout Loop (Systemic)

This loop shows up in **workplaces, communities, and group systems** where value is equated with _output_. It mirrors the personal “productivity–rage–collapse” cycle but scaled up.

1. **Overcommitment / hustle** — individuals or teams overwork to _earn belonging_.

   - Exit whisper: _“Your worth is not measured in hours or metrics.”_

2. **Conflict / disruption** — tension surfaces through arguments, passive-aggression, or visible breakdowns.

   - Exit whisper: _“We see the pressure. Let’s pause before it breaks us.”_

3. **Burnout / disengagement** — collapse into exhaustion, absenteeism, resignation, or quiet quitting.
   - Exit whisper: _“Rest is not failure. Restoration is part of the work.”_

       |                                                                      v
       '----------------- unmet value + recognition needs --------------------'
```

## Notes

- This loop is **cultural**, not just individual. It thrives in environments where **output = identity**.
- Conflict here is a **signal flare** that the system is overextended.
- Exit whispers anchor **new cultural agreements**: worth is inherent, rest is valued, recognition is not conditional.
- Breaking the loop requires **cultural reset + collective permission to rest and recalibrate**.
