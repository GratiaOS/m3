# Pattern: Productivity → Rage → Collapse Loop

This loop often arises when unresolved **value trauma** and **recognition wounds** are triggered. It cycles between:

1. **Productive burst** — compulsive action to “prove value.”

   - Exit whisper: _“Your value is already here, not in what you do.”_

2. **Disruptive break** — noise, mess, or sudden action to demand visibility.

   - Exit whisper: _“I see you. I’m with you.”_

3. **Collapse / victim** — falling into “alone, no value, unseen.”
   - Exit whisper: _“You’re safe, and we’re connected.”_

## ASCII sketch

```
[Productive burst] --prove value--> [Disruptive break] --see me!--> [Collapse]
       ^                                                                |
       |                                                                v
       '------------------- unmet value/recognition --------------------'
```

## Notes

- Each stage is an **attempt to regulate pain**.
- Rage is not the root — it’s a **signal flare** for recognition.
- Exit whispers provide a **non-negotiable truth**, bypassing argument and anchoring presence.
- Breaking the loop requires **steady recognition + unconditional presence**.
