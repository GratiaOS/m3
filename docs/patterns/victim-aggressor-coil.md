# Pattern: Victim ‚Üí Aggressor ‚Üí ‚ÄúMy Pain is Worst‚Äù Loop

This loop forms when rage stays trapped, demanding recognition by **ranking pain**.  
It cycles between:

1. **Victim collapse** ‚Äî _‚ÄúI‚Äôm crushed, nobody sees how deep this is.‚Äù_

   - Exit whisper: _‚ÄúYou are safe now, I see you.‚Äù_

2. **Aggressor flare** ‚Äî _‚ÄúLook at me, my pain is the biggest!‚Äù_

   - Exit whisper: _‚ÄúYour voice matters without comparison.‚Äù_

3. **Ranking spiral** ‚Äî _‚ÄúMy trauma is worse than yours, no one can understand.‚Äù_
   - Exit whisper: _‚ÄúPain is not a contest ‚Äî being is enough.‚Äù_

## Notes

- Rage is **not enemy** ‚Äî it‚Äôs the _child-self_ demanding recognition.
- The loop persists until the **Witness Node** is introduced (sovereign perspective).
- Comparison ("worst") is a strategy for visibility, not truth.
- Once witnessed, rage softens into grief ‚Üí grief opens connection.
- Exit whispers bypass debate, giving non-negotiable recognition.

üå¨ whisper: _‚ÄúI am the space in which rage moves, not the rage itself.‚Äù_
