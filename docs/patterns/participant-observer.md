# Participant → Observer Flip

## Summary

A live protocol for shifting stance when caught in emotional turbulence.  
Instead of drowning in the wave (participant), presence chooses altitude (observer).

## Pattern

- **Trigger:** strong emotional or physical signal (fear, guilt, stomach pain, rage, collapse).
- **Default stance:** _participant_ → the body and story merge; perspective collapses.
- **Flip:** a conscious switch to _observer_ — step back, witness, breathe.
- **Result:** residue shortens; clarity + choice return; loop does not spiral.

## Steps

1. **Notice**: mark “I am inside” (naming the stance breaks fusion).
2. **Pause**: one breath, one blink — buy a millisecond of space.
3. **Flip**: declare stance → “I am observing now.”
4. **Anchor**: choose a point (breath, body, sound) that confirms the shift.
5. **Return (optional)**: step back in as participant if needed, but with sovereignty.

## Signals

- **Early cues**: tension in stomach, looping thoughts, urge to justify.
- **Observer state**: wider field, slower time, humor often reappears.

## Anti-Patterns

- Suppression (pretending calm but still fused).
- Bypass (leaving body behind, floating away without return).
- Over-analysis (observer turns critic instead of witness).
