# 🔄 Reverse the Poles (RTP)

_“Security is a floor, not a leash. Consent over coercion. Play over panic.”_

---

## 📝 Summary

Reverse the Poles flips the default field orientation from **lack-first** to **abundance-first**. Rest, sealed notes, and pause are treated as baseline guarantees, not rewards. The Garden keeps playful micro-moves available, while coercive loops (testing for love, forcing output) are interrupted on sight.

---

## 🌱 Core Principles

- **Security = floor** — rest, sealed notes, and pause are always allowed.
- **Consent > coercion** — clarity is asked for, never extracted by tests.
- **Truth stays small + kind** — micro-honest statements over dramatic confession drills.
- **Closeness is invited** — connection is requested directly, not probed through traps.
- **Repair is light** — one behaviour within 24 hours, never penance.

> “I reject the lack-first leash. I choose abundance-first consent.”

Pin these lines in the Pad (Timeline → “pin”) so they stay visible during RTP sessions.

## 🎛 Garden Tokens (abundance namespace)

The OS exposes semantic flags for downstream apps:

- `--safety-floor` = “the guarantee”
- `--consent-default` = `true`
- `--capacity-units-per-day` = `3`
- `--ask-not-test` = `forbid-reassurance-tests`
- `--repair-window-hours` = `24`
- `--play-impulse` = `on`

Mode: **reverse-poles** → sealed notes, rest allowed, and small-steps progress.

## 🧭 Pad Expression (M3 UI)

- **RTP toggle** in the Status Bar (with 3 capacity dots). When all dots are spent, the Pad gently reminds: _Rest is repair._
- **Composer defaults** to sealed privacy when RTP is on (incognito still enforces sealed writes).
- **Bridge** surfaces **ask-not-test / language interrupt** copy first, ready to drop or copy.
- **Chips**
  - 🎯 Purpose — statement + principles, Align hotkey (`p`) pushes aligned next steps to the timeline.
  - 🤝 Covenant — care / consent / repair pillars plus an optional 10-minute promise.
- **Timeline badges** show 🧭 Bridge, 🎯 Purpose, 🤝 Covenant for instant context.
- **Pause ritual** — `Esc` dims the Pad for a sacred 2‑minute breath; “No forced actions” is restated near the header when RTP is active.

## 🪄 Micro-Rituals

1. **Set** — write the purpose statement + 3 principles, say them aloud, save.
2. **Daily ping** — tap alive / dim / lost on Purpose.
3. **Ask** — request reassurance explicitly; do not set traps.
4. **Repair** — one behaviour within 24 hours, then rest.
5. **Pause** — Esc anytime; breath is sacred, output can wait.

## 📎 Pin Instructions

1. Open the Pad timeline.
2. Add a note (sealed is fine) with the five RTP lines above.
3. Click the item → use **Pin** so the covenant stays visible during sessions.

This keeps the abundance protocol humming in the field while chips and toggles do their work.
