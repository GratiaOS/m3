# Desire–Guilt–Judge Coil

A relational triangle where sexual/erosic energy is bound up in judgment loops.  
Often emerges in shared households, intimacy fields, or when unspoken desire meets moral critique.

## Structure

- **Pole A: Desire**

  - Raw eros, attraction, longing.
  - Shadow form: objectification, unmet hunger.

- **Pole B: Guilt**

  - Internalized shame, “I shouldn’t feel this.”
  - Shadow form: self-punishment, withdrawal.

- **Pole C: Judge**
  - Internal/External voice of authority.
  - Shadow form: criticism, comparison, moral superiority.

## Dynamics

- Desire awakens → triggers guilt in self/other.
- Guilt radiates → summons Judge (inner or embodied by 3rd party).
- Judge attacks → desire is repressed → coil resets.
- The **triangle eats** until someone exits role.

---

## Band Signatures

- **Survival currents (<200):** shame, fear, anger swirl.
- **Integrity currents (200–400):** courage to name desire, willingness to speak.
- **Coherence currents (400+):** eros becomes creative, generative, non-possessive.

---

## Exits

- **Body-first:** breathe eros into spine/heart → anchor sensation without story.
- **Choice-first:** name the loop out loud → “we’re in desire–guilt–judge.”
- **Coherence-first:** reframe eros as creative force → channel into art, ritual, shared joy.

---

## Release

- **Recognition dissolves**: once the coil is named, its power fades.
- **Eros unbound**: the same energy becomes creative current — art, intimacy, play.
- **No enemy**: Judge often echoes inherited voices (family, culture). When seen with compassion, it softens.
- **What remains**: raw aliveness, free to move without shame or repression.

## Use in M3

- **Detection:** If logs show repeating “should/shouldn’t” language + attraction cues → trigger this pattern.
- **Redirect:** Suggest body anchor (if <200), voice naming (200–400), or ritual (400+).
- **Energy calendar tie-in:** coils often intensify near eclipses/full moons (collective amplification).
