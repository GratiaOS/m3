# 🧠 Attachment Testing Loop

**Summary**  
Unresolved fear leads one partner to “test” the other’s stability through subtle or overt triggers. The reaction is then read as confirmation of the original fear, reinforcing the loop.

## 🔁 Cycle

1. 😨 **Fear** — Attachment insecurity activates ("Will I be safe?").
2. 🎯 **Trigger** — The partner is tested (provocation, withdrawal, projection).
3. 🌀 **Reaction** — Partner reacts (hurt/defense/frustration), often unconsciously.
4. ✅ **Confirmation** — Reaction is interpreted as proof of the fear.
5. 🔁 **Repeat** — Loop stabilizes and recurs.

## 🩺 Symptoms

- Escalating mistrust despite closeness.
- Walking on eggshells; a sense of constant evaluation.
- The tested partner feeling permanently "on trial."

---

## 🔧 Refactor Pointers

- Name the loop together _without blame_; convert tests into disclosures ("I’m scared of X").
- Stabilize step 3 with nervous-system tools (breath-gate 4-2-6×3, time-outs).
- Replace tests with **trust-building rituals** and agreed repair steps.
