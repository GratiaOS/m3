# 🌀 Over-Analysis Self-Perpetuating Loop

**Summary**  
Excessive analysis, intended to bring clarity, actually keeps the emotional pattern alive by never letting it fully resolve.

---

## 🔁 Cycle

1. 🧠 **Analysis impulse** — Trigger → mind starts dissecting.
2. 🔍 **Recursive thinking** — Each insight spawns more threads/sub-loops.
3. 🫁 **Emotional suspension** — Feelings are paused, not integrated.
4. ♻️ **Loop reopening** — Because nothing lands, the pattern reactivates when touched.
5. 🔁 **Repeat** — System remains in debug mode indefinitely.

## 🩺 Symptoms

- Mental exhaustion without relief.
- Late-night spiraling; rehashing conversations.
- Temporary clarity followed by confusion returning.

---

## 🔧 Refactor Pointers

- Set explicit **analysis cut-off** rituals and time boxes.
- Anchor insights somatically (breath, writing, small action) to _close the loop_.
- Accept that some loops resolve through **rest**, not cognition.
- Use trusted mirrors to reality-check and ground.
