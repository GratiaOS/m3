# 🧭 Sibling Trust Loop

**Summary**  
A recursive loop of baiting → exploiting → abandoning → forced reconciliation, often held together by a “forever pact” or unspoken emotional contract. Common in sibling or close-bond dynamics where trust and boundaries were unstable early on.

## 🔁 Cycle

1. 🎣 **Bait** — Emotional hook or promise that reopens the channel (nostalgia, guilt, crisis).
2. 🧨 **Exploit** — After trust is granted, boundaries are violated (resource drain, manipulation, dumping).
3. 🚪 **Abandon** — The exploiter withdraws; implicit trust breaks.
4. 🕊️ **Forgive-me push** — Pressured reconciliation (“we’re family, forever”), bypassing accountability.
5. 🤝 **Pact** — Verbal/emotional “forever” promise renewed.
6. 🔁 **Repeat** — Cycle resets at bait.

## 🩺 Symptoms

- Emotional exhaustion for the non-initiating party.
- Confusion between love, obligation, and boundaries.
- Partners/outsiders get pulled in via proxy dynamics.

---

## 🔧 Refactor Pointers

- Name the loop explicitly to all involved.
- Separate **love** from **contract**; end pacts that require self-betrayal.
- Refuse reconciliation without concrete change between steps 4–5.
- Support sovereignty: healing does not require unhealthy agreements.
