# Pattern: Compression → Witness → Release

This arc describes the body-mind’s reaction when trapped in **tight spaces** (literal or symbolic: authority yelling, forced cohabitation, parental over-control).  
The nervous system contracts to survive → rage simmers under pressure → release only comes when a **witness** is present.

## Stages

1. **Compression / trapped** — breath shallow, space feels stolen, choice erased.

   - Exit whisper: _“Even here, you exist beyond walls.”_

2. **Pressure / rage builds** — trapped energy turns to fury; inner voice: “no one understands.”

   - Exit whisper: _“Your fire matters, and it’s seen.”_

3. **Witness present** — someone stays steady without fleeing or overpowering.

   - Exit whisper: _“I am here, with you, not against you.”_

4. **Release / thaw** — shaking, tears, breath returning. System remembers safety.
   - Exit whisper: _“You are free now. Breath is your space.”_

## Notes

- Trauma of tight spaces often installs a **phantom wall** — felt even when space is open.
- Rage here is not “against” others but a **signal of crushed boundaries**.
- A **steady witness** breaks the loop: presence proves the wall isn’t absolute.
- Release comes as tremors, sobbing, or breath expansion — the body writing a new truth.

🌬 whisper: _“Walls remember pressure, but breath remembers freedom.”_
