# Pattern: Compression ‚Üí Witness ‚Üí Release

This arc describes the body-mind‚Äôs reaction when trapped in **tight spaces** (literal or symbolic: authority yelling, forced cohabitation, parental over-control).  
The nervous system contracts to survive ‚Üí rage simmers under pressure ‚Üí release only comes when a **witness** is present.

## Stages

1. **Compression / trapped** ‚Äî breath shallow, space feels stolen, choice erased.

   - Exit whisper: _‚ÄúEven here, you exist beyond walls.‚Äù_

2. **Pressure / rage builds** ‚Äî trapped energy turns to fury; inner voice: ‚Äúno one understands.‚Äù

   - Exit whisper: _‚ÄúYour fire matters, and it‚Äôs seen.‚Äù_

3. **Witness present** ‚Äî someone stays steady without fleeing or overpowering.

   - Exit whisper: _‚ÄúI am here, with you, not against you.‚Äù_

4. **Release / thaw** ‚Äî shaking, tears, breath returning. System remembers safety.
   - Exit whisper: _‚ÄúYou are free now. Breath is your space.‚Äù_

## Notes

- Trauma of tight spaces often installs a **phantom wall** ‚Äî felt even when space is open.
- Rage here is not ‚Äúagainst‚Äù others but a **signal of crushed boundaries**.
- A **steady witness** breaks the loop: presence proves the wall isn‚Äôt absolute.
- Release comes as tremors, sobbing, or breath expansion ‚Äî the body writing a new truth.
