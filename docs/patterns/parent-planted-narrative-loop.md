# 🧬 Parent-Planted Narrative Loop

**Summary**  
An inherited label, fear, or story from a parent gets embedded in adult relationships, shaping behaviors and interpretations long after the original context is gone.

---

## 🔁 Cycle

1. 🪴 **Planting** — Parent seeds a loaded narrative (e.g., "You’re unstable," "You’ll be abandoned").
2. 🧠 **Internalization** — Child adapts to the story as a survival map.
3. 🧍 **Projection** — Narrative is projected onto partners/situations.
4. 🔄 **Reinforcement** — Triggered behaviors evoke reactions that seem to "prove" the story.
5. 🌱 **Transmission** — The loop spreads to others (partners, kids) through fear or language.
6. 🔁 **Repeat** — Narrative persists across generations.
