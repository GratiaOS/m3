# Remote Activation

## Description

The **Remote Activation** pattern describes a design where an outer or external field activates an inner pattern or process. Instead of the inner pattern initiating on its own, it awaits a signal or trigger from an external source. This allows for controlled activation, coordination, and dynamic response to external stimuli.

In this pattern, the external field acts as a catalyst or key, unlocking the behavior of the inner pattern. This separation of activation and behavior enables flexibility and modularity in system design.

## Dynamics

- **Resonance:** The inner pattern resonates only when the external field matches certain conditions, enabling selective activation.
- **Choice:** Multiple inner patterns may exist, but only those targeted by the external activation become active, allowing for dynamic selection.
- **Sovereignty:** The external field controls the activation timing, but the inner pattern retains sovereignty over its behavior once activated.

## Exit Whispers

- Consider how the external activation can be decoupled from the inner pattern's implementation to maximize modularity.
- Use Remote Activation to enable dynamic feature toggling or conditional behavior in complex systems.
- Beware of tight coupling; ensure that the activation mechanism remains flexible and extensible.
