# Pattern: Energy Influx → Deflection → Morale Collapse

This loop shows up when leadership is confused with _permission giving_ instead of _active anchoring_.  
It often plays out in workplaces, but the root is universal: energy offered but never carried forward.

---

## Stages

1. **Energy influx** — team brings ideas, effort, excitement.

   - Pulse: contribution, hope, shared willingness.

2. **Deflection / non-listening** — boss nods, says _“freedom is yours”_, but doesn’t take notes, change self, or provide real support.

   - Pulse: responsibility pushed down without shared load.

3. **Momentum loss** — 2-3 waves of unanchored energy pass, then morale collapses.
   - Pulse: hopelessness, disengagement, learned helplessness.

## Exit whispers

- To the team: _“Your energy is valid even if the system refuses to move.”_
- To the leader: _“Your example teaches more than your permission.”_
- To the system: _“Energy without anchor is wasted. Anchor first, then delegate.”_

## Notes

- **Hidden wound**: recognition without continuity.
- **Lesson**: leadership ≠ passive openness, but _active anchoring_.
- Real leadership is like a **convoy of birds**: the front rotates naturally. Whoever has energy leads for a while, then falls back into the stream to rest.
- A **boss** stays at the front for power; a **leader** flows in and out so the flock survives.
- Breaking the loop requires _example, follow-through, and steady presence_.

🌬 whisper: “Momentum dies when no one carries it; leadership is carrying first.”
