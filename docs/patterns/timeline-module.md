# Timeline Module (aka time-line)

Time is a module like energy or trust. Switching timelines changes the operating rules (tempo, reveals, affordance), not reality. We escort Heavy → Slow → Flow, never rush.

## Timelines

- **Heavy** — friction high, choices few, breath first.
- **Slow** — spacious, gentle reveals, one clear action + helper.
- **Flow** — aligned motion, snappy-but-soft, “one true next”.

## UX Rules

- Do not coerce; offer a better time-line.
- Clamp choices in Heavy, reveal progressively in Slow, celebrate lightly in Flow.
- Say why a nudge happens (kind language).

🌬 **whisper:** _choose the time that loves you back._
