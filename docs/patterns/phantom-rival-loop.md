# Phantom Rival Loop 🫥🪞

> compare → believe → contract → confirm

---

## What it is ✨

A jealousy‑driven pattern where you summon a “rival” in your head, treat them as real, then others respond to the tension you broadcast. Shame lands, connection shrinks, the loop confirms itself.

---

## Early signals 🔎

- 🧠 Mind auto‑comparing (“they’re better / I’m behind”)
- 💥 Urge to check, test, or withdraw
- 💓 Chest tight / 😬 jaw clench / 😵‍💫 stomach flip on waking
- 🧾 Narrative certainty without fresh facts

---

## Likely roots (map, not blame) 🗺️

- 🫶 Attachment fear (abandonment / replaceability)
- 👶 Old “left‑behind” imprints (e.g., separations at age 6–8)
- 🏆 Performance worth: winning = safe / losing = unlovable
- ⏳ Family field where reassurance was scarce or delayed

---

## The loop (mechanics) ♻️

1. 🔍 **Compare** (internal rival appears)
2. 🎭 **Believe** (treat fantasy as fact)
3. 🧱 **Contract** (protective distance, testing, withhold)
4. 🔁 **Confirm** (other feels the chill → reacts, which looks like “proof”)

---

## Fast bridge (3–4 min) 🌉

1. 🫁 **Body reset**: 6 breaths (in 3, out 6). Feet grounded, jaw soft.
2. 🏷️ **Label**: “phantom rival loop.” Naming shrinks fusion.
3. 📋 **Reality test**: 3 **facts** you know vs 3 **guesses** you’re making.
4. 💎 **Self‑esteem micro‑dose**: name one non‑interchangeable gift you bring (humor, steadiness, vision, touch).
5. ❤️‍🩹 **Re‑open**: hand to chest — “I choose presence over the phantom.”

---

## One‑true‑next prompts (Compass) 🧭

- ❓ “Is this a **fact** or a **forecast**?”
- 🧩 “Can I be **curious** before I’m certain?”
- 🪜 “What’s the **smallest ask** that brings me closer?”

---

## Talk script (no blame) 💬

> “I notice I’m running a comparison story and it tenses me up.  
> The facts are X; the guesses are Y.  
> What I actually want is to feel close to you — can we check this together?”

---

## Boundaries for self 🚧

- 🚫 No decisions while contracted.
- 🙈 No social‑media “evidence collecting.”
- 🤝 No tests/withholding; **ask directly**.

---

## Micro‑experiments 🌱

- 🌟 **Visibility rep**: share one real win from today (to self or partner).
- ⏱️ **Attention swap (90s)**: for every 30s on “them,” spend 90s building _your_ thing.
- 🔭 **Warm mirror**: name one thing you appreciate about _your_ way of loving.

---

## For N (annotation) 🧒

- History: anger when “losing,” fear of being left behind (age ~7 separation).
- Bridge emphasis: body reset + reality test + straight ask.
- Reassurance form: predictable check‑ins, explicit “I’m here,” concrete plans.

---

## When to escalate (care path) 🧗

- If it loops **> 2 weeks** despite bridges, add a **shared ritual**: weekly 15‑min “facts & asks.”
- If rage/accusation keeps spiking, consider guided support (attachment‑informed therapist or somatic coach).
