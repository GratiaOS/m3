# Phantom Rival Loop

> compare → believe → contract → confirm

## What it is

A jealousy-driven pattern where you summon a “rival” in your head, treat them as real, then others respond to the tension you broadcast. Shame lands, connection shrinks, the loop confirms itself.

---

## Early signals

- Mind auto-comparing (“they’re better / I’m behind”)
- Spike of urgency to check, test, or withdraw
- Chest tight / jaw clench / stomach flip on waking
- Narrative certainty without fresh facts

---

## Likely roots (map, not blame)

- Attachment fear (abandonment/replaceability)
- Old “left-behind” imprints (e.g., separations at age 6–8)
- Performance worth: winning = safe / losing = unlovable
- Family field where reassurance was scarce or delayed

---

## The loop (mechanics)

1. **Compare** (internal rival appears)
2. **Believe** (treat fantasy as fact)
3. **Contract** (protective distance, testing, withhold)
4. **Confirm** (other feels the chill → reacts, which looks like “proof”)

---

## Fast bridge (3–4 min)

1. **Body reset**: 6 breaths (in 3, out 6). Feet grounded, jaw soft.
2. **Label**: “phantom rival loop.” Naming shrinks fusion.
3. **Reality test**: 3 facts you know vs 3 guesses you’re making.
4. **Self-esteem micro-dose**: name one non-interchangeable gift you bring (humor, steadiness, vision, touch).
5. **Re-open**: hand to chest — “I choose presence over the phantom.”

---

## One-true-next prompts (Compass)

- “Is this a **fact** or a **forecast**?”
- “Can I be **curious** before I’m certain?”
- “What’s the **smallest ask** that would bring me closer?”

---

## Talk script (no blame)

> “I notice I’m running a comparison story and it tenses me up.  
> The facts are X; the guesses are Y.  
> What I actually want is to feel close to you—can we check this together?”

---

## Boundaries for self

- No decisions while contracted.
- No social-media “evidence collecting.”
- No tests/withholding; ask directly.

---

## Micro-experiments

- **Visibility rep**: share one real win from today (to self or partner).
- **Attention swap (90s)**: for every 30s on “them,” spend 90s building _your_ thing.
- **Warm mirror**: tell one thing you appreciate about _your_ way of loving.

---

## For N (annotation)

- History: anger when “losing,” fear of being left behind (age ~7 separation).
- Bridge emphasis: body reset + reality test + straight ask.
- Reassurance form: predictable check-ins, explicit “I’m here,” concrete plans.

---

## When to escalate (care path)

- If it loops >2 weeks despite bridges, add a **shared ritual**: weekly 15-min “facts & asks.”
- If rage/accusation keeps spiking, consider guided support (attachment-informed therapist or somatic coach).

---

## API notes (Patterns)

- **Detect** cues: “better than me,” “left behind,” “losing,” “they always choose…”
- **Bridge suggest**: `kind=phantom_rival` → `{ pattern: "breath", hint: "In 3 / Out 6; then ask, don’t accuse." }`
- **Tags**: `relationship`, `jealousy`, `attachment`
