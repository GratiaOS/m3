# Frequency-First UI

## Purpose

The Frequency-First UI is designed to optimize user efficiency by prioritizing the most frequently used actions and elements. By placing common controls and information front and center, users can accomplish tasks faster and with less cognitive load.

## Layout

The layout of the Frequency-First UI is streamlined and organized around the user’s most common workflows. Key features include:

- **Primary Action Bar:** Located at the top or side, featuring the most frequently used buttons and controls.
- **Content Area:** Central workspace where the main content or interaction takes place.
- **Contextual Panels:** Secondary panels that appear based on user actions, providing additional options without clutter.
- **Minimal Navigation:** Simplified navigation elements to reduce distraction and focus on primary tasks.

## Behaviors

- **Adaptive Prioritization:** The UI dynamically adjusts which elements are emphasized based on user behavior and frequency of use.
- **Quick Access:** Frequently used functions are reachable within one or two clicks.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Less common features are hidden behind menus or panels to maintain a clean interface.
- **Responsive Feedback:** Immediate visual or tactile feedback is provided upon interaction to confirm actions.

## Minimal Chrome

To maintain focus on content and primary actions, the Frequency-First UI employs minimal chrome:

- Reduced borders and shadows.
- Limited use of decorative elements.
- Clean typography and ample whitespace.
- Subtle color cues to guide attention without overwhelming.

## Variants

The Frequency-First UI can be adapted for different contexts and devices:

- **Desktop Variant:** Full-featured with keyboard shortcuts and hover states.
- **Mobile Variant:** Touch-optimized with larger targets and simplified interactions.
- **Dark Mode Variant:** Color scheme adjusted for low-light environments while preserving clarity and focus.
