# Consciousness Gradient (inspired by Hawkins)

This page offers a _compatibility map_ between M3 signals and a well-known “map of consciousness” idea.
We do not reproduce proprietary charts; we express our own gradient and how M3 uses it.

## Bands (our phrasing)

- **Survival Currents (≈<200)** — shame • guilt • apathy • grief • fear • desire • anger • pride
- **Integrity Currents (≈200–400)** — courage • neutrality • willingness • acceptance • reason
- **Coherence Currents (≈400–600+)** — understanding • love • joy • peace • (nonverbal/ineffable)

## Why this exists in M3

- Gives shared language to _redirects_: below ≈200 → body-first bridges; ≈200–400 → choice/structure; 400+ → sustain/expand.
- Lets UI color and copy adapt to the _band_, not just the emotion word.

## M3 Usage (examples)

- **EmotionalOS**:
  - `<200` → suggest: breath → doorway → anchor (body-first).
  - `200–400` → suggest: one small action, boundary, or reframe (choice-first).
  - `400+` → suggest: gratitude ritual, sharing, stillness (stabilize coherence).
- **Patterns**:
  - Detect cues → estimate band → pick intervention recipe.
- **Energy Calendar**:
  - During eclipses, expect dips toward Survival/Integrity bands; plan “headlight commits”.

## Operational markers & bridging

To make the gradient actionable, M3 maps each band to **observable markers** (language, physiology, behavior) and to minimal interventions — the “bridge” — that are most likely to help in the moment.

### How it works (brief)

1. **Detect**: lightweight heuristics on text, voice, or input fields produce a `band_guess` with a confidence score.
2. **Pick**: select the bridge recipe for the guessed band (body-first → breath; identity band → options/reframe; relational → listening/ritual).
3. **Offer**: propose a single micro-action (1–2 items) and a safety fallback (pause + agree time).
4. **Log**: if user accepts, create a short mark and add a tiny trace (no surveillance — sovereign metadata only).

### Example markers & bridges

- **Survival Currents (≈<200)**

  - Markers: short sentences, urgency words, “can’t”, “need now”, increased speech rate, physiological cues (if available).
  - Bridge: breath recipe (box / double exhale) + one grounding doorway action.
  - Example offer: _“Quick breath: in4-hold4-out6 × 4. Sip water. Name 3 objects.”_

- **Integrity Currents (≈200–400)**

  - Markers: debating, boundary language, “should/shouldn’t”, requests for options.
  - Bridge: one small choice + boundary script.
  - Example offer: _“Two tiny options: A) set a 10-min boundary; B) reframe the immediate ask.”_

- **Coherence Currents (≈400–600+)**
  - Markers: long-form reflection, paradox language, repair-focused phrases, sharing gratitude.
  - Bridge: gratitude ritual or invitation to share/repair.
  - Example offer: _“Invite: name one thing you’re grateful for and share it with one person.”_

> Implementation note: always attach a `confidence` score; if `confidence < 0.6`, present the suggestion as _optional_ and give “manual choose” fallback.

## Color Bands (UI hint)

- Survival Currents → warm red/orange
- Integrity Currents → green/cyan
- Coherence Currents → blue/violet

## Notes

- This is a _gradient_, not a judgment.
- Band ≠ identity. It’s just the _current_ you’re surfing.
