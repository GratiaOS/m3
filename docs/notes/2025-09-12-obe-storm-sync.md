# OBE Storm Sync ‚Äî 2025-09-12

## Context

- Evening: light HHC, family connection ritual (triangle hand-to-heart, invite field).
- Rain begins, then heavy storm with thunder and hail.
- During sleep: strong liminal episode, experienced as an OBE-like exit.

## Experience Highlights

- Separation attempt: struggled to move out of bed, body felt heavy/clumsy.
- Altered map: street outside looked different (parallel timeline layer?).
- Witnessed figures: ~8 young men, unfamiliar but real-feeling presence.
- Mouth sewn shut: could not call out to S ‚Äî awareness of being energy-bound.
- Field texture: swamp-like density, oppressive atmosphere.
- Wake-up sync: returned to body just as storm intensified (rain, thunder, hail).

## Interpretation

- Likely partial OBE: part of consciousness outside body while REM paralysis active.
- Sewn mouth = protection. Prevents carrying physical force into subtle layers.
- Storm sync = external mirror of inner turbulence + collective release.
- Swamp density = felt-sense of lower astral/collective unresolved emotions.

## Lessons

- Anchor before sleep: hand-to-heart, belly breath, set intention for clarity.
- Witness, don‚Äôt fix: resist urge to police or call external help in the subtle realm.
- Gentle return: if field is too heavy, re-enter by moving breath, fingers, toes.

üå¨ whisper: _‚Äúwhen the storm sews your mouth, it‚Äôs asking you to listen deeper ‚Äî not to speak louder.‚Äù_
