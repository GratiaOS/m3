## 🌔 Prep Note — Blood Moon 7–8 Sept 2025

- **Theme**: “Reveal” — not about hiding or exposure, but about **what wants to be seen**.
- **Practice**: stay with breath + gratitude ledger; let fear of judgment pass through like a shadow.
- **Body**: ground bare feet / stone contact during peak.
- **Family**: invite presence, no forcing; everyone’s rhythm is valid.
- **Meta**: treat as a rehearsal’s culmination — not a verdict, but a marker in the arc.

🌬 whisper: _“the moon reveals not to accuse, but to illumine the path already underfoot.”_
