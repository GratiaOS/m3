## 🌑 Solar Eclipse & Equinox — 21 Sept 2025

- **Theme**: “Reset” — not erasure, but a deep pause where endings and beginnings braid together.
- **Practice**: name what is closing; breathe once for release, once for welcome. Let stillness be the teacher.
- **Body**: soften belly / hands open; align with sunrise or sunset if possible.
- **Family**: honor each person’s pace in transition; offer presence, not solutions.
- **Meta**: mark this as a hinge — the arc bends, but direction is chosen in micro-acts of attention.

### Personal sigil — the Sun as login

During the eclipse I looked toward the Sun in my usual way (not the glare but the presence). The visual that landed: a centered, calm “soul” with a moving circular border — like an 8px gradient ring slowly rotating. It felt exactly like a login screen: a portal UI asking for recognition. In that moment I experienced a small, clear sensation of unlocking and syncing — as if my personal presence (my USB / vault) clicked into the field.

Note: this is symbolic and actionable. I linked this impression to `docs/identity/usb-vault.md` as a metaphoric UI pattern: portal-login, three quick actions (Speak • Mark • Bridge) and the idea of portable presence.

🌬 whisper: _“the sun hides to show the seam — night and day stitched anew.”_
