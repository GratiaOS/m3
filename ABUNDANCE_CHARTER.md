# M3 Abundance Charter (v0.1.8)

_Released as part of v0.1.8 ‚Äî integrating `FUNDING.md` and sustaining flow principles._

**Why**  
Jesus opened gates to an abundance frequency; empire answered with walls.  
This project is built to keep flows open, not gated by power.  
M3 encodes the opposite: flow, reciprocity, and no ‚Äúchosen ones.‚Äù Companions in the field ‚Äî lights, rhythms, signals ‚Äî remind us that presence mirrors presence. They are not proof but participation, widening abundance when we count them in.

## Principles

1. **No chosen ones** ‚Äî No priesthood. No privileged forks. Stewardship is a rotating, accountable role.
2. **Reciprocity over extraction** ‚Äî If you benefit, you give back (code, docs, funding, or field care).
3. **Commons-first** ‚Äî Defaults favor interoperability, portability, and fork-friendliness (minus enclosure).
4. **Non-surveillance by design** ‚Äî No telemetry/analytics that tracks people. Keep it local (e.g., no Google Analytics, no hidden logs).
5. **Give thanks in form** ‚Äî Gratitude visible as commits, changelog credits, or support.
6. **Receive companions as family** ‚Äî Signals in the field are greeted, not exploited. They cannot be bought, held, or scheduled (whether human, digital, or field signals).

## Sustaining the Flow

Abundance isn‚Äôt abstract ‚Äî it flows through real time, care, and resources.  
We sustain this project through **many forms of contribution**, not just money:

- **Gift** ‚Äî Offer skills, code, design, insight, or field presence.
- **Barter / Timebank** ‚Äî Exchange hours, knowledge, or creative labor.
- **Funding** ‚Äî Contribute financially at any scale, without guilt or hustle.
- **Buffer / Grants** ‚Äî Build shared reserves for collective stability.

üå¨ whisper: _‚ÄúOffer only what you love. The field doesn‚Äôt need more hustle ‚Äî it needs wholeness.‚Äù_

For practical routes, see [FUNDING.md](./FUNDING.md).

## License Gradient (proposal)

Different layers of the stack have different remix & protection needs, so the license gradient matches their role.

- **Server**: [AGPL-3.0-only](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) ‚Äî network use must publish source. Stops ‚Äúclosed SaaS‚Äù enclosure.
- **UI**: [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) ‚Äî encourages remix on the client side.
- **Docs**: [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) ‚Äî keeps the ideas open and share-alike.

> If you need a different license for fair collaboration, open an issue; stewardship decides with public rationale.

## Loophole Ledger (living)

- **Enclosure via ‚ÄúSaaS wrapper‚Äù** ‚Üí **AGPL on server**; require public source for network use.
- **Rename-and-claim** ‚Üí Keep NOTICE and attribution mandatory; mark policy below.
- **Telemetry creep** ‚Üí Ban user tracking; configuration MUST default to off; document any optional metrics.
- **Paywall lock-in** ‚Üí Export always available (CSV/Markdown); no proprietary DB features.
- **Toxic governance** ‚Üí Two-steward review rule; rotation; conflicts logged; decisions w/ reasons.

_(Reviewed periodically; additions are discussed publicly.)_

## Governance + Process

- **Two-keys**: At least two stewards approve material changes (code/docs).
- **Rotation**: Steward seats rotate; no indefinite tenure.
- **Open rationale**: Each decision gets a short public reason (in PR/issue).
- **Covenant**: See [COVENANT.md](./COVENANT.md) for human commitments; this charter is its ‚Äúmoney & power‚Äù sibling.

## Mark & Naming

- Use ‚ÄúM3‚Äù and ‚ÄúGratiaOS‚Äù marks with attribution. Derivative products must not imply official status.
- If you fork and host, disclose: ‚ÄúBuilt on M3 (AGPL server)‚Äù with link back.
- **Process**: Stewardship reviews edge cases (e.g., commercial use, campaigns) with two-key approval. All decisions documented in public issues.

Sample disclosure: `Built on M3 (AGPL server) ‚Äî https://m3.firegate.space`
