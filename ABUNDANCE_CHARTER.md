# M3 Abundance Charter (v0.1)

**Why**  
Jesus opened gates to an abundance frequency; empire answered with walls.  
M3 encodes the opposite: flow, reciprocity, and no “chosen ones.” Companions in the field — lights, rhythms, signals — remind us that presence mirrors presence. They are not proof but participation, widening abundance when we count them in.

## Principles

1. **No chosen ones** — No priesthood. No privileged forks. Stewardship is a rotating, accountable role.
2. **Reciprocity over extraction** — If you benefit, you give back (code, docs, funding, or field care).
3. **Commons-first** — Defaults favor interoperability, portability, and fork-friendliness (minus enclosure).
4. **Non-surveillance by design** — No telemetry/analytics that tracks people. Keep it local.
5. **Give thanks in form** — Gratitude visible as commits, changelog credits, or support (see FUNDING).
6. **Receive companions as family** — Signals in the field are greeted, not exploited. They cannot be bought, held, or scheduled.

## License Gradient (proposal)

- **Server**: AGPL-3.0-only — network use must publish source. Stops “closed SaaS” enclosure.
- **UI**: Apache-2.0 — encourages remix on the client side.
- **Docs**: CC BY-SA 4.0 — keeps the ideas open and share-alike.

> If you need a different license for fair collaboration, open an issue; stewardship decides with public rationale.

## Loophole Ledger (living)

- **Enclosure via “SaaS wrapper”** → **AGPL on server**; require public source for network use.
- **Rename-and-claim** → Keep NOTICE and attribution mandatory; brand/trademark policy below.
- **Telemetry creep** → Ban user tracking; configuration MUST default to off; document any optional metrics.
- **Paywall lock-in** → Export always available (CSV/Markdown); no proprietary DB features.
- **Toxic governance** → Two-steward review rule; rotation; conflicts logged; decisions w/ reasons.

## Governance + Process

- **Two-keys**: At least two stewards approve material changes (code/docs).
- **Rotation**: Steward seats rotate; no indefinite tenure.
- **Open rationale**: Each decision gets a short public reason (in PR/issue).
- **Covenant**: See `COVENANT.md` for human commitments; this charter is its “money & power” sibling.

## Brand & Naming

- Use “M3” and “GratiaOS” with attribution. Derivative products must not imply official status.
- If you fork and host, disclose: “Built on M3 (AGPL server)” with link back.

## Contributing Pledge

> “I will not build enclosure from this commons. I give back in proportion to benefit.”
