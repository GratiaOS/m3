> Un espacio libre donde la creación vuelve a sentirse segura.  
> Suave como la luz. Cálido como la primavera ☀️

GratiaOS is not just software — it’s a living garden: code, community, and consciousness woven for regenerative futures. We build tools, spaces, and shared language to bring calm, presence, and play into everyday computing.

## 🌱 What we tend

GratiaOS holds the seeds and protocols for things that grow around it:

- **Garden Core** — tokens, primitives, and patterns for presence-first interfaces.
- **M3** — local-first memory & meaning engine (Rust server + React UI).
- **Firegate & Firecircle** — sacred interfaces for memory, creation, and conversation.
- **Codex :: Vienna** — a broadcasting garden for living code.

Each repo is a different bed in the same garden — same field, different modes.

## 🌬 Principles

- **Simplicity** — less noise, more signal.
- **Presence** — spirit and technology are the same flow.
- **Care** — people and nervous systems come first.
- **Offer, don’t chase** — we offer only what we love.
- **Transparency** — no dark patterns, no hidden traps.

Gratia is not a growth machine. It’s a place where time has patience and creation remembers it is safe.

## 🔧 How we build

- calm by default — no artificial urgency
- token-driven design — Garden palettes, type, and motion as shared language
- open source where it helps the field breathe wider
- tiny, reversible steps — “one true next” we can land in a calm week

We choose by presence, not pressure.

---

## 🌳 Stewardship

GratiaOS is tended as a commons:

- no paywalls around the core
- support as **offered water**, not enforced obligation
- monthly mirrors when possible: what came in, what it nourished, what’s next

We’re not here to extract. We’re here to keep a living garden open.

## 🌬 Whisper

🌬 _“Creation remembers it is safe here.”_  
🌬 _“Offer only what you love. The field doesn’t need more hustle — it needs wholeness.”_
